My code compiles and runs correctly. The major problem I ran into was
forgetting to null the old location in the array after moving the final
node to the root. This caused your leftChild() and rightChild() to return
what looked like children, which threw off my bubbleDown() for a while.
This is good because it let me catch the memory leak (the old nodes wouldn't
be released even after being removed from the heap), but if your children
functions checked size and not capacity (lines 63 and 73, probably other places
too), you might avoid making people think they're did their algorithm
incorrectly.
