Task 1:
	In Ubuntu 11.10, ProPolice is enabled by default. As a result,
	the overflow is detected, resulting in a nice stacktrace and
	memory dump.
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab1$ ./a.out 
		Password (up to 30 chars): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
		DENIED!
		*** stack smashing detected ***: ./a.out terminated
		======= Backtrace: =========
		...
		======= Memory map: ========
		...

	If that's disabled (-fno-stack-protector), we end up with a plain
	old "Segmentation Fault!" error.

Task 2:
	Code
	
Task 3:
	%s - Segmentation fault (read out of program space?)
	%d - Nice little number
	%x - 1
	
Task 4:
	
	
Task 5:
	The integer overflow causes a new root user to be created, not the normal user that was
	probably meant to occur.
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./t5
		Last user was ID 4294967295
		New user has ID 0
		New user created with root privileges
