# Introduction #
The files in this repository are a random collection of things I've done over the years. Most notably (at least at this time) is most of my college programs, from worthless hello worlds to... well, whatever we did in college that was more significant.

However, I make no guarantees. Some of the code here was completely use-once sorts of things for me, so I may not have done things the best way, the most efficient way, or the prettiest way.
