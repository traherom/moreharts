Task 1:
	In Ubuntu 11.10, ProPolice is enabled by default. As a result,
	the overflow is detected, resulting in a nice stacktrace and
	memory dump.
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab1$ ./a.out 
		Password (up to 30 chars): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
		DENIED!
		*** stack smashing detected ***: ./a.out terminated
		======= Backtrace: =========
		...
		======= Memory map: ========
		...

	If that's disabled (-fno-stack-protector), we end up with a plain
	old "Segmentation Fault!" error.

Task 2:
	Code. Sample output:
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task2and3 
		Password: aoeu
		You entered aoeu
		Denied
		
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task2and3 
		Password: bah
		You entered bah
		Welcome
		
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task2and3 
		Password: 12345678901234567890
		You entered 12345678901234567890
		Denied
		
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task2and3 
		Password: 12345678901234567890123456
		The password must be 20 or fewer characters
		Password: 12345
		You entered 12345
		Denied

	
Task 3:
	Output:
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task2and3
		Password: %8x%8x%8x%8x%8x
		You entered        1 8049ff4 80486b1 8048490       0
		Denied
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task2and3
		Password: %s%s%s%s
		Segmentation fault
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task2and3
		Password: %d
		You entered 1
		Denied
	
Task 4:
	Code. Sample output for various inputs:
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task4
		Password: %s
		The password must be only alphanumeric and <= 20 characters long
		Password: 123
		You entered 123
		Denied
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task4
		Password: aoeuoaeu234
		You entered aoeuoaeu234
		Denied
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task4
		Password: aoeu$aochr
		The password must be only alphanumeric and <= 20 characters long
		Password: ao.
		The password must be only alphanumeric and <= 20 characters long
		Password: a
		You entered a
		Denied

Task 5:
	The integer overflow causes a new root user to be created, not the normal user that was
	probably meant to occur.
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./t5
		Last user was ID 4294967295
		New user has ID 0
		New user created with root privileges

Task 6:
	Code. Overflow is now blocked:
		traherom@vmramlap:~/src/afit/secure_software/lab2$ ./task6
		Last user was ID 4294967295
		Maximum number of users exceeded, unable to create new user
